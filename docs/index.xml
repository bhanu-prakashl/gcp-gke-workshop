      <description>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) is the process for which your software components are built from code, integrated, tested, released, deployed and ultimately delivered to end-users. CI/CD pipelines are the software assembly line that orchestrates the building of your software. This CI/CD pipeline line requires infrastructure. Cloud computing has allowed this infrastructure to become dynamic and ephemeral. On cloud infrastructure, your CI/CD pipelines scale up and down to meet your software delivery demands.</description>

      <title>Binary Repository Management</title>
      <link>https://jfrogtraining.github.io/gcp-gke-workshop/2_devops_cloud/22_binary_repository_management.html</link>

      <description>A Binary Repository Manager is a software hub that simplifies the development process for different teams across an organization by helping them to collaborate on building coherent and compatible software components. It does this by centralizing the management of all the binary artifacts generated and used by the organization, thereby overcoming the incredible complexity arising from diverse binary artifact types, their position in the overall workflow and the set of dependencies between them.</description>

      <description>Any security issue identified by a security scanning may be reviewed by a small security team that may lack the technical knowledge. This challenge can be reduced by shifting left to the developer and operations teams, making them also responsible for security and compliance. This moves security earlier in the software delivery process. Source code, dependency and artifact security scanning are some examples of moving security into the development process. Implementing the identification of security issues earlier in the CI/CD pipeline, as well as automating security and compliance policies in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), rather than using manual processes, is crucial.</description>

      <description>The JFrog Platform is designed to meet the growing needs of companies to develop and distribute software in the cloud. It provides DevOps teams with the tools needed to create, manage, secure and deploy software with ease. These tools cover everything from continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), binary repository management, artifact maturity, security and vulnerability protection (DevSecOps), release management, analytics and distribution.
JFrog Artifactory is an Artifact Repository Manager that fully supports software packages created by any language or technology.</description>

      <title>Build the JFrog CLI Docker Image</title>
      <link>https://jfrogtraining.github.io/gcp-gke-workshop/5_build_publish_app/51_build_jfrog_cli_image.html</link>

      <guid>https://jfrogtraining.github.io/gcp-gke-workshop/5_build_publish_app/51_build_jfrog_cli_image.html</guid>
      <description>First, we will use Google Cloud Build to create a npm docker image with the JFrog CLI. This will enable us to use JFrog CLI to build npm packages.
Google Cloud Build uses Docker to execute builds. For each build step, Cloud Build executes a Docker container as an instance of docker run.
   Return to your Cloud Shell terminal and change directory to gcp-gke-workshop/jfrog-cli-docker.
  We will use Google Cloud Build to create JFrog CLI docker image.</description>

      <guid>https://jfrogtraining.github.io/gcp-gke-workshop/5_build_publish_app/52_build_docker_image.html</guid>
      <description>Now, we can use new JFrog CLI image to build the NPM application Docker image and push it to Artifactory&amp;rsquo;s Docker repository using Cloud Build Trigger.
  Return to your Google Cloud Shell terminal and change directory to gcp-gke-workshop/workshop-app.
  Use Google Cloud Build, trigger and the JFrog CLI to build the NPM Docker image. The cloud build trigger uses cloudbuild.yaml. If you look inside this file, you will find it performs following steps:</description>

      <description>If you have your own Google account and have your own GCP environment, skip this step.
 This workshop requires a GCP environment. If this is a JFrog and Google hosted event, your instructor will provide a link and an activation code. The following steps walk through the process of obtaining a GCP environment using the provided link and activation code. Otherwise, use your own GCP environment and skip this step.</description>

      <description>In this section, we will create GKE Clusters in our Google Cloud Shell using the gcloud CLI.
The gcloud command-line interface is the primary CLI tool to create and manage Google Cloud resources. You can use this tool to perform many common platform tasks either from the command line or in scripts and other automations.
  In your Google Cloud Shell, execute the following command to set an environment variable for the GCP environment project ID.</description>
