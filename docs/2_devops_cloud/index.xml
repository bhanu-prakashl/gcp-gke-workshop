Google Cloud provides fully managed services which scale up and down to meet demand, including:
 Google Cloud Build - flexible platform for developer automation, including capabilities to build and test container and non-container artifacts Google Cloud Deploy - purpose-built continuous delivery with approval gates for GCP runtimes, including GKE.</description>
