In this workshop, we used Google Cloud Build to build JFrog CLI, then used the Cloud Build and JFrog Platform to build an application, manage the artifacts, scan the artifacts for security vulnerabilities and license compliance, and publish the artifacts of your application to a staging repository. Then we used Coud Deploy to deploy your application to GKE so that end-users can access it. 
The JFrog Platform and Google Cloud demonstrate how you can build a DevSecOps cloud platform to delivery your software to your end-users securily. This modernizes your software delivery life cycle enabling your organization to deliver quality software continuously and maintain a Secure Software Chain by leveraging advanced cloud services and infrastructure.
